<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">a. We have integrated Plug-ins on our web services. These plug-ins are indicated by the respective button belonging to the service. With the help of the plug-ins, users can share or post links to the corresponding websites in social networks such as Facebook or Twitter or recommend the contents there. Through your active interaction with these plugins (e.g. by clicking the respective button or leaving a comment) the information is transmitted directly to the respective service and stored there.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">b. When you visit one of our web services that contain an activated plugin, your browser establishes a connection with the servers of the respective service, which in turn transmits the content of the plugin to your browser, which then integrates it into the displayed page. Thus, the information about the visit of our web services is forwarded to the respective service. We do not collect personal data ourselves by means of the social plugins or about their use and have no influence on which data an activated plugin collects and how these are used by the provider. It must be assumed that at least the IP address and device-related information is collected and used. It is also possible that the service provider will attempt to store cookies on the computer used. If you are logged in to the respective service at the same time as visiting our web services via your personal user account (e.g., via another browser session), the service provider can assign the visit to our web services to your account.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">c. Usual social media plug-ins transfer the above-mentioned user personal data to the operator of the social network each time the website is accessed. This also applies when you the website user is not logged in or a member of the network. In order to prevent the unconscious and unintentional collection and transmission of personal data to the service provider, we use the so-called "2-click solution" on our web services: In order to activate a desired plugin, it must first be activated by clicking on the corresponding button. Only when the plugin is activated, the collection of personal data and its transfer to the service provider is triggered. Without activating the plugin, which is only done at your own request, you can therefore surf our web services without transmitting personal data to the operators of social networks in a data protection compliant manner. In this case, data processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interests (Section 12(f), DPA) of preserving your freedom of opinion and making contributions more easily (co-)shareable.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">For data protection reasons, we use the so-called “Shariff solution” developed by c't magazine. The Shariff solution functions in a way that as a first step, all personal data and functions required to display the buttons are provided by our web server. Only when you decide to share an article via the corresponding button and click on it, personal data will be transferred to the operator of the respective social media service. In this case, data processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interests of preserving your freedom of opinion and making contributions more easily (co-)shareable (Section 12(f), DPA).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial"><span style="color:#000000">d. The plug-ins used are limited to applications of the companies listed under "Social media, portals". We have no influence on the collected personal data and personal data processing procedures, nor are we aware of the full scope of personal data collection, the purposes of processing, the storage periods. We also have no information about the deletion of the collected personal data by the plug-in provider. We make every effort to comply with our duty to inform and to offer those affected maximum transparency of information. Should you require more detailed information about personal data processing by these companies, we recommend that you contact the controller of the respective service. Should our cooperation be necessary, we will of course support you in enforcing your rights as a data subject.</span></span></span></p>
