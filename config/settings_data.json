Place the mattress box near your bed frame or the clear space where you'll be placing the mattress.\n<br><br>\n2. Open the top of the box and tilt it until it's laid out horizontally on the floor. You can then carefully pull the vacuum-packed mattress out.\n<br><br>\n3. Use scissors or the included cutter to cut open the first layer of plastic. Make sure that the clear space around you is enough for the unrolled mattress to be laid flat. You can also choose to unroll the mattress on top of your bed frame.\n<br><br>\n4. Once the mattress is fully unrolled, slit open one side of the last layer of plastic around the mattress itself to let air inflate the mattress.\n<br><br>\n5. While the mattress is inflating itself, you can slowly slide off the last layer of plastic. While you can use the mattress during the mattress without it during the 100-night trial, we ask that you keep it until your trial ends.This is because in the event that you wish to return or replace your mattress, our courier requires that it be wrapped in plastic.\n<br><br>\n6. It takes 20 minutes for the mattress to inflate enough for use. Any large or visible dips that result from storage in the warehouse should also inflate and decompress after 2 hours.\n<br><br>\n7. You should now be all set to unwind and stretch out on your beautiful, new mattress.\n<br><br>\nYou can also find a video tutorial on how to unpack your mattress at https:\/\/youtu.be\/BInK_ARfhHo."
